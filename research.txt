research:


git fetch origin

# See if there are any incoming changes
git log HEAD..origin/master --oneline
(I'm assuming origin/master is your remote tracking branch)

If any commits are listed in the output above, then you have incoming changes -- you need to merge. If no commits are listed by git log then there is nothing to merge.

Note that this will work even if you are on a feature branch -- that does not have a tracking remote, since if explicitly refers to origin/master instead of implicitly using the upstream branch remembered by Git.
