 **GitSync is basically just 1 applescript compiled as an app.** In theory you can use GitSync without installing it. Security is handled through https and passwords are handled by apples own keychain. All code can be inspected here on github. [DM me on twitter if you need help setting it up](https://twitter.com/GitSyncApp)

And one more thing. GitSync really works. **26.000 commits and counting.**
